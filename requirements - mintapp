Within the Mint phone app, part of our monetization is from advertising for financial services we think our customers would benefit from.  Intuit is looking to better target these, so that we show users fewer advertisements they would not be interested in.  We would like you to take a look at some data on the most prominent spot within the Mint App.

 

Attached, we have a sample data set of 2,000 hypothetical Mint users that use our iOS app.  There are two sheets in the workbook, one contains details related to the offers shown to the users in the app, and the other contains data related to the profile of users.

 

Below is the description of the data columns:

 

Userid – Unique ID for each user

ID – Random ID assigned for each row in the table

OfferID – Each offer has a unique OfferID

Offer time_stamp – When the impression/click occurred

Event – 1 denotes impression and 2 denotes click

Merchant – Merchant related to each offer

Profile_creation_time – When the user profile was created

Number_of_Bank_Accounts – Number of bank accounts linked to Mint

Monthly Income – Monthly income for September

Monthly Spend- Monthly spend for September

Number_of_Logins – Number of times a user logs-in on the App in September

 

Your solution should cover the following points:

·        Your strategy for optimization

·        What additional data would you want to track in order to do better?

·        What additional factors would you think would be beneficial to look at?
