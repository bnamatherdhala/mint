based on the clusrered customer profiles
c) we need need to rank the offers based on the revenure they generate and also how popular those ads

4) get the most effective transactions data if possible  see what type of transactions they are
for example: If a customer  if a freqent traveller based on his purchases of flight tickets/ car rentals/ hotels
he has a high probability of choosing a offer which has more savings for flight rewards / car insurance/ hotels rewards
than other cards
If his transactions are mainly on education/ loans/ home/ groceries/ 
just show those offerings as its high probability he will select those

5) have customer specific options for the product ...work with product teams how to make mint the best place 
to make your finances better
make customer specific offerings like havce  general plan, targeted savings plan-- like similar to the goals option 

like for example i want next two months to make more savings on resturants / groceries/ education/ insurance --
the app does that for that which shows those offerings that you need based on your request..
In this case even based on my last few months clicks might be high for other offerings the next few months 
i might be more intrested in my targted offerings.. the app must be automated in the algorithms to manage its offers
