1. We need more customer information for better advertising our Offers ...more customer profile information
a) get the marketing information like emails data , customer ads data see the customer behaviour of those advertisiting 
b) get the customer information like Age, sex , profession to make offers clustured based on there actions
c) get the information of there current offers and more specific so that we can co relate those with the offers we can advertise


2. get the financial predictors to make decisions with the offers .. how a predictor might increase the intuits revenue 
or may decrease the revenue
b) what offers are generating more revenue try to make them better as they constuite more revenue , by ranking the offers
based on the clusrered customer profiles
c) we need need to rank the offers based on the revenure they generate and also how popular those ads
are and create that ranking algorithm based on above predictors  and  have the ads offered 

3) Collect the A/B testing data , log data , cookie data 
a) check whats  the size of the ads that are being placed
b) content of the ads 
c) fonts of the ads, colour of the ads that has high impressions and clicks



4) get the most effective transactions data if possible  see what type of transactions they are
for example: If a customer  if a freqent traveller based on his purchases of flight tickets/ car rentals/ hotels
he has a high probability of choosing a offer which has more savings for flight rewards / car insurance/ hotels rewards
than other cards
If his transactions are mainly on education/ loans/ home/ groceries/ 
just show those offerings as its high probability he will select those 
b) Combine this predictors with the clicks/impressions to make our offerings more effective


5) have customer specific options for the product ...work with product teams how to make mint the best place 
to make your finances better
make customer specific offerings like havce  general plan, targeted savings plan
like for example i want next two months to make more savings on resturants / groceries/ education/ insurance --
the app does that for that which shows those offerings that you need based on your request..
In this case even based on my last few months clicks might be high for other offerings the next few months 
i might be more intrested in my targted offerings.. the app must be automated in the algorithms to manage its offers
